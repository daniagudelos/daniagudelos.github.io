I don’t know what to say \
I don’t know what to feel \
I don’t know how we got here \
This shit ain’t fucking real

Is it you still who loves me? \
It is me still who cares \
If I am not who you are loving \
Tell me why should I stay? 

I don’t get how we ended \
In such dark and cold place \
Can’t I still be your princess? \
Can’t you still be my Mann?

It was love what we had there \
It is love what I feel \
Do you still care as I care? \
Do you still fall for me?

If it is not you in my arms \
How can I carry on? \
I don’t want other people \
All I want is your love
