You have been lost before \
You have been hurt \
You have pulled all your walls up \
and you’ve hidden yourself from the world

You’ve packed up all of your tears \
The ones that you’ve already cried \
and those you are saving for the future

You’ve reinvented yourself so many times, \
that no one, not even you, can tell \
how many layers are there to be torn up \
on the way to your heart

And you cover it up \
You get all sweet on the surface \
Like if no one would ever notice \
But deep down you will always know \
The bitterness within

You just wait for someone \
Someone who dares to take a bite \
Someone loves all of your flavors \
Someone you can trust with your vulnerability \
And all that remains hidden, packed up and covered

It will all start again, but \
you have been lost before
