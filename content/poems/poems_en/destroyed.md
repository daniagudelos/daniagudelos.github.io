I came to bring you inside \
On what it feels like to be destroyed \
A void inside your body \
Never allows you to feel whole \
A hole burning in your soul \
Cuz time has gone to waste \
And the ways that brought you happiness \
Now bring you just despair

Too scared to ask the question \
"Am I broken beyond repair?" \
Can't dare to trust your own thoughts \
Cuz' who betrayed you, was yourself  \
Feels like being trapped in your own head \
And it is cold, it is dark, it is wet \
You are statuette, an eggshells mosaic  \
Playing the Russian roulette

Can not see clear where you are standing \
Although the eyes are opened wide \
An undercried urge to start running fills the bloodstream \
Need to cease existence for a while \
Seems like there is nothing left to be thought of \
Nothing to laugh or cry about \
A broken vow to scape this hollow \
Tears like a stream till the next drought
