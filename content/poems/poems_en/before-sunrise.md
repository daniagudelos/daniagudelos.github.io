I’ll visit you in my memories \
At night before the sunrise \
Your arms around me \
My heart pounding \
Your body’s tension

Whispering in the dark \
Don’t let go of me \
Keep me close \
Pull me closer 

Wishing for longer hours \
Just one more second \
Would be long enough \
To kiss each freckle and each mole

I have to go, I know \
We have good reasons to say no \
This is goodbye, for sure \
So see you before the next dawn
